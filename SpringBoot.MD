# ðŸ”§ Autoconfiguration

Autoconfiguration is one of Spring Bootâ€™s core features. It tries to automatically configure your Spring application based on the dependencies present in the classpath and the beans you define.

How it works:
Spring Boot uses @EnableAutoConfiguration (usually through @SpringBootApplication) to enable auto-configuration.

For example, if spring-boot-starter-data-jpa is on the classpath, Spring Boot will:

Configure a DataSource.

Set up JPA entity manager and repositories automatically.

Benefits:
No need to write boilerplate configuration.

Sensible defaults help you get started quickly.

You can override or customize any part with your own config.

# ðŸ“¦ Starters
Starters are pre-configured Maven/Gradle dependencies that you can include in your project to bring in a set of related libraries and configurations.

Examples:
spring-boot-starter-web: Includes Spring MVC, Jackson, and an embedded Tomcat server.

spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: Includes Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and a database connector.

spring-boot-starter-security: Includes Spring Security with sensible defaults.

Benefits:
Simplifies dependency management.

Reduces setup time by bundling related dependencies together.

Consistent and curated by the Spring Boot team.

# ðŸ“Š Actuator
Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application.

Features:
Built-in endpoints to expose application health, metrics, info, beans, environment, etc.

Common endpoints:

/actuator/health â€“ Application health status

/actuator/metrics â€“ Metrics like memory, CPU, HTTP requests

/actuator/env â€“ Environment properties

/actuator/beans â€“ Loaded Spring beans

Configuration:
Add spring-boot-starter-actuator to your project.

Customize endpoints via application.properties or application.yml.

Security:
Endpoints can be secured or exposed selectively (e.g., only /health and /info for public access).
